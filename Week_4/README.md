<h1 align="center">Week 7: Day 31 to 35 of The Hacking Project: Advanced Rails !</h1>

All this week you will be doing a threaded project which is an Eventbrite-like. You're going to make a site where users can create events, and register for events. The project will start by building the backend of the application, with a working mailer and in production.

This week you will do a project that will accompany you all along. At the end you will have a working application in production that you can use. The application will be a kind of Eventbrite applied to your city: users will be able to create events, set a price, upload a profile picture, and then visitors of the application will be able to join the events by paying the price. Of course, there will be a user management with login / logout, and we even have an administrator interface to validate the events of the application.
