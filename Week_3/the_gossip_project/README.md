<h1 align="center">Week 6 of The Hacking Project: Intermediate Rails !</h1>

Day 1: We're going to ask you to make a simple application, which will make you manipulate the links, and the routes. And quickly the controller.

Day 2: In this project you will manipulate your first controller and play with it to create a gossip!

Day 3: At The Hacking Project, there's a lot of stuff going on between the crew. So we need to create a platform where anyone can come and write gossip, edit it, and even destroy it. And to gossip thoroughly, we'll set up a gossip comment system.

Day 4: We are going to give the possibility of liking and commenting the gossips of the Gossip Project.

Day 5: You're going to add a cookie system to The Gossip Project, and then code a system that respects the privacy of users. So cool.
