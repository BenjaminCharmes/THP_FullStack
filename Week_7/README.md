<h1 align="center">Week 10: Day 46 to 50 of The Hacking Project: Project: online shop !</h1>

Welcome to the team project. Your goal will be to build a complex website, put it online, and improve it. In one week.

The objective is simple: we will give you a detailed specification, and you will have to make a working site that meets that specification. You will first create and publish a working MVP of this site, and then code additional features.

In preparation for next week, you will be well versed in many aspects, and will be able to launch your final project in the best possible conditions.

On Thursday, each member of your group will have to hand in the project.
