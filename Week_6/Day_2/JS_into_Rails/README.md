<h1 align="center">Day 42 of The Hacking Project: Further into OOP !</h1>

In this project, we will combine all the notions you have seen so far to make you play with Rails and JavaScript. This way, you'll have applications that make beautiful explosions. How cool is that?

This project will be in three parts:

The first is a simple JavaScript hookup to your Rails application
The second is making a page with a simple animation
The last one is the configuration of JavaScript for your Rails application
