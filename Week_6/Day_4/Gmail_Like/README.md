<h1 align="center">Day 44 of The Hacking Project: AJAX (2/2) !</h1>

For this project, we're going to ask you to make an Email Viewer which is nothing more or less than a very basic version of Gmail. Globally the application will display a single page with 2 columns:

A column containing the list of emails in the database;
A column displaying the content of the email the user has just clicked on.
