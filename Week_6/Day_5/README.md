<h1 align="center">Day 45 of The Hacking Project: Teamwork and Git workflow !</h1>

This project will require you to make a plan of attack for teamwork. Indeed, from Monday onwards you will stop working on solo projects and learn to work in a team. To train you to manage a project in a team, this day will be dedicated to the preparation of a project.

At THP we've had you coding in hothead mode for almost two months. That's good for getting the basics down. But as soon as projects start to involve more than one person and more than one day's work, continuing like that is like exploding in mid-air. So, for this project today you're not going to code: you're going to spend the day organising yourself, and getting ready to code.

We're going to give you the specs of an application, then you're going to have to prepare the pre-code:

Get organised to prepare the GitHub repository on which you will work together
Break down the specs into distinct and achievable tasks and distribute the work to be done
