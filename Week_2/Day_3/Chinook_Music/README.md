<h1 align="center">Day 23 of The Hacking Project: Playing with excels !</h1>

It's time for you to practice your new skills on Rails models: we're going to create complete DBs and seeder them.

In this project, we'll focus on the first step of creating a Rails app: setting up the models and the DB. We'll have you create several models and populate several DBs with entries created either in the console or via a seed.
