<h1 align="center">Day 24 of The Hacking Project: OOP of Champions: tic-tac-toe !</h1>

You will do some sites that will train you with relational databases

For this project, we will ask you to create models for several applications. These will be your first advanced tables, but at your level there is no stopping you.

For all these sites, we are going to ask you to create only the models, no views / controller. ✌️
