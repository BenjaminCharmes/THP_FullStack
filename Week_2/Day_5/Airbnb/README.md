<h1 align="center">Day 25 of The Hacking Project: MVC - Ruby Version !</h1>

We think you're already solid enough on models to do the back-end of your favourite rental site.

Here we go! Here's a real project where you're going to build a real robust database. For this occasion, we're going to ask you to redo the database and the models of a well-known application in the startup world: Airbnb. Yes, today, after not even 4 weeks of learning to code, you are going to rebuild the back-end of Airbnb.

For today's project, we'll simply give you the pitch of the application. From that, you will design the database by yourself, then make your models robust by putting validations.

We are very proud to offer you such a concrete project so quickly and we hope you will have as much fun doing it as we did writing it.
