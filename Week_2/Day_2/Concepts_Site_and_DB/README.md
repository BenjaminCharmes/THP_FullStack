<h1 align="center">Day 22 of The Hacking Project: Further into OOP !</h1>

We'll create a database and play with a test database.

Every programmer needs to know how to create a robust back-end: even those who eventually specialize in front-end will need to fully understand how a DB works to make pretty dynamic views. And since you'll be designing and manipulating hundreds of databases in your programming life, you might as well start right away 😃
