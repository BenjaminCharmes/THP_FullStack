<h1 align="center">Day 17 of The Hacking Project: Further into OOP !</h1>

We are going to code a little game in the Fornite style in Object Oriented Programming

Now that you have all the OOP tools in hand, we're going to show you how to use them to make a little Fortnite-like fighting game. So obviously, I'm going to calm you down right away: we'll have to make do with visuals that are much less ambitious than the real game... But the principle will be there: players will fight each other in a big arena, exchange blows, and you'll only be able to win if you're the last one standing! 😎
