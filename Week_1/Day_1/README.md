<h1 align="center">Day 16 of The Hacking Project: Discovering OOP !</h1>

We are going to code a nice calendar according to OOP principles!

Enough talk, let's get practical! There is a lot of information to learn today: nothing better than practice to get into the swing of OOP.

Today you're going to revolutionise the world of technology because you're going to create a new calendar to make appointments super efficiently. Pierre Valade is in for a treat!

You're going to code an application where you can create events with a start date, a duration, and a name. You will be able to attach a location to them, users (who will attend), and the total list of appointments will be displayed. The advantage of thinking "object" for this kind of application should quickly become apparent: its decomposition will be extremely simple.
