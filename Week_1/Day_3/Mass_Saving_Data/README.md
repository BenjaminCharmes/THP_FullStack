<h1 align="center">Day 18 of The Hacking Project: Playing with excels !</h1>

This project allows you to apply your file management skills to save all the data you retrieve in beautiful files

Together we will save a whole bunch of data in a database in the form of a spreadsheet, CSV or JSON. All the programs of the day will have to be made in OOP: everything must be contained in classes, 1 class per file. No more small programs made in a hurry.
