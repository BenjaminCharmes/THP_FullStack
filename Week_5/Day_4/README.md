<h1 align="center">Day 39 of The Hacking Project: OOP of Champions: tic-tac-toe !</h1>

After more than a month of coding in Ruby, thinking in Ruby, and for the more involved, dreaming in Ruby, we're going to give you a little headache (one more!) by asking you to completely change your habits. It's time to switch to JavaScript! Yes, it's as if, after having eaten German for 6 weeks, you had to start from scratch but this time with Spanish... tough.

So yes, it's going to sting a bit because it's new for you. But mastering a second language in programming is a real plus. For two reasons:

Firstly, because JavaScript (JS) is an indispensable language on the web. It is what makes web pages interactive. It is therefore a must on the front.
But in general, you have to get used to not "thinking Ruby" but to take a little more height and "think programming". Mastering two languages will allow you to understand the logic common to any piece of code.
You'll see that while the form is very different between Ruby and JS (and this is probably what will confuse you the most today), the content is similar in many ways: we'll declare variables, write functions, make loops, set up if-else, etc. Both languages are object-oriented, and both have a very high degree of flexibility. Both languages are object-oriented so you can continue to practice OOP!

Fasten your seatbelt, here we go.
