<h1 align="center">Day 36 of The Hacking Project: Making your own UI kit !</h1>

In this resource, we will ask you to create your own atoms in the making of a complete UI kit.

In this project, we're going to take you through CSS and design by asking you to create your own UI kit! You'll be able to apply your design, marketing, or common sense skills to an index.html file that will display your kit in a well-presented way (much like this UI kit presentation on uibundle).

You will have to find the colours of your site, the typography, design elements like buttons and others. Thanks to this UI kit, you will be able to easily design molecules, organisms, and you will have a great theme for your future website.
