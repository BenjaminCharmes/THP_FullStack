Let's practice manipulating the DOM with JavaScript

We have planned a great project for you to practice twisting the DOM in all directions. The work will be divided into 2 parts: first we will browse the DOM, walk around the HTML page, remove information, but without touching anything. Then we will take a page and modify it in all directions only via our JavaScript code.

After that you'll be convinced: when you have your hand in the JS file linked to an HTML page, you have your hand on its content and you can modify it completely.
