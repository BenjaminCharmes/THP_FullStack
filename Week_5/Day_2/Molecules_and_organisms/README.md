<h1 align="center">Day 37 of The Hacking Project: Molecules and organisms !</h1>

You will use components to design the molecules and organisms that make up the majority of web pages.

Yesterday you saw how to make a UI kit from scratch. You managed to define a graphic charter, and that's a good start for not too ugly sites. Today, we're going to give you a pre-made kit, and then you'll have to build molecules and organisms from it. The goal is to have you code the few molecules that will take up 80% of your site, and then you'll just have to insert them for a killer front end.
