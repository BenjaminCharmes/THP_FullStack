<h1 align="center">Day 38 of The Hacking Project: Rails, front, and components !</h1>

You will take over the Eventbrite project (Week 4) and then arrange all the molecules into partials.

In this project, you are going to take the molecules and organisms you made yesterday and put them into your Eventbrite application in partials format in Rails.

This is a very important day that allows you to really break your old school relationship with the web that makes us think of a site page by page and not component by component. So, by seeing your pages as a succession of components, it will be much easier for you to build websites. In addition to offering beautiful sites, it will be much faster to think components than pages. If your components are already made, your pages will only be partial renders 🤑
